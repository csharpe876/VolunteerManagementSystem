## Requirements
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6+

## Build
```bash
mvn -version         # ensure Maven is installed
mvn clean package    # produces target/volunteer-management-system-1.0.0-shaded.jar
```

This produces `target/volunteer-management-system-1.0.0.jar`

## Run
```bash
java -jar target/volunteer-management-system-1.0.0.jar
```

Or simply double-click the JAR file on systems with Java installed.

## Data Storage
All application data is automatically saved to a single database file and persists between sessions:
- **Location**: `database/vmsdatabase.txt` (created in application directory)
- **Format**: Java serialization (single-file database)
- **Contents**: 
  - Volunteers
  - Events
  - Attendance records
  - Timesheets
  - Announcements
  - User accounts (with hashed passwords)
- **Backup**: Simply copy `database/vmsdatabase.txt` to backup all data
- **Restore**: Replace the file to restore a previous backup

## Architecture
```
src/main/java/com/fstgc/vms/
├── Main.java           # Application entry point
├── controller/         # Business logic orchestration (5 controllers)
├── model/              # Domain models (8 models + 11 enums)
├── repository/         # Data access layer (interfaces)
│   └── memory/         # In-memory implementations (5 repositories)
├── service/            # Core business services (6 services)
├── ui/                 # Swing GUI components (LoginDialog, SystemUI)
└── util/               # Utility classes (DataPersistence)
```

## First-Time Setup
1. Launch the application
2. The `database` folder and `vmsdatabase.txt` file are automatically created
3. Default admin account is automatically created on first run
4. Login with admin credentials (username: `admin`, password: `admin123`)
5. Or click "Sign Up" to create a new volunteer account

## Admin Features
Admins (ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN roles) have additional capabilities:
-  Edit volunteer, event, and announcement information
-  Delete volunteers, events, and announcements
-  Edit timesheet details (hours, dates, status)
-  View audit logs showing who last modified each record
-  Approve/reject timesheets
-  All modifications are tracked with username and timestamp

## Date Formats
- All date inputs use **MM-DD-YYYY** format
- Examples: 12-02-2025, 01-15-2026

## Attendance & Hours
- Users enter total hours worked directly when recording attendance
- No check-in/check-out process - simplified to hours entry
- Timesheets are automatically created when attendance is recorded
- Timesheet dates automatically match the event date
- Admins can manually adjust hours in timesheet editing

## Notes
- All passwords are hashed using SHA-256
- New signups are automatically assigned the VOLUNTEER role
- Only SUPER_ADMIN can manage other administrators
- The database file is portable - copy it to transfer data between installations
- All edit/delete operations require admin privileges
- Audit trail tracks all modifications with username and timestamp

---

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**
   - **Models**: Domain objects (Volunteer, Event, etc.)
   - **Views**: UI components (LoginDialog, SystemUI)
   - **Controllers**: Request handlers (VolunteerController, etc.)

### 2. **Repository Pattern**
   - Abstracts data access layer
   - Interfaces define contracts
   - In-memory implementations for current version
   - Easy to swap for database implementations (SQL, NoSQL)

### 3. **Service Layer Pattern**
   - Encapsulates business logic
   - Coordinates multiple repositories
   - Reusable across different UI implementations

### 4. **Dependency Injection**
   - Manual constructor injection
   - Clear dependency hierarchy
   - Testable components

### 5. **Singleton Pattern**
   - AuthenticationService maintains current user session
   - DataPersistence manages single database file

### 6. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Permissions checked at UI layer (show/hide elements)
   - Permissions enforced at service layer (business logic)
   - Four roles: SUPER_ADMIN, ADMIN, COORDINATOR, VOLUNTEER

---

## Data Flow Example: Recording Attendance

1. **User Action**: User enters hours and clicks "Record Attendance" in dialog
2. **UI Layer**: `SystemUI.showAttendanceDialog()` captures volunteerId, eventId, and hoursWorked
3. **Controller**: Calls `AttendanceController.recordAttendance(volunteerId, eventId, hoursWorked)`
4. **Service**: `AttendanceService.recordAttendance()`:
   - Validates volunteer and event exist
   - Creates new Attendance record with current timestamp and hours
   - Updates Event: `currentRegistrations++`, `capacity--`
   - Automatically creates Timesheet with event ID, event name, and hours
   - Timesheet period dates set to match event date
   - Saves attendance to repository
   - Returns Attendance object
5. **Repository**: `InMemoryAttendanceRepository.save()` stores in ConcurrentHashMap
6. **Timesheet**: `InMemoryTimesheetRepository.save()` stores linked timesheet
7. **Persistence**: `DataPersistence.saveData()` serializes all data to disk
8. **UI Update**: Dialog shows success message, refreshes all panels
9. **Dashboard**: Updated statistics reflect new attendance and hours

---

## Role-Based UI Behavior

### Dashboard Statistics
- **Volunteers/Coordinators**: See personal "My Hours" and "My Badges"
- **Admins**: See system-wide "Total Hours (All Users)" and "Total Badges (All Users)"

### Events Panel
- **All Users**: View events in three columns (Upcoming | Past & Completed | Cancelled)
- **Volunteers/Coordinators**: No create/edit/delete buttons
- **Admins**: "Create Event" button visible, Edit/Status/Delete buttons on event cards, status badges shown

### Attendance Panel
- **All Users**: Can record attendance with hours entry
- **Volunteers/Coordinators**: Volunteer ID auto-populated and read-only, enter hours worked
- **Admins**: Can enter any volunteer ID and hours
- **Table Columns**: ID, Volunteer ID, Event ID, Hours, Status, Actions

### Timesheets Panel
- **All Users**: Can view timesheets
- **Volunteers/Coordinators**: Can submit timesheets (default status: PENDING), cannot change status
- **Admins**: Can edit timesheets, approve/reject, change status

### Announcements Panel
- **All Users**: Can read announcements
- **Volunteers/Coordinators**: No create/edit/delete buttons
- **Admins**: "New Announcement" button visible, Edit/Delete available

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Thread Safety
- `ConcurrentHashMap` used in all repositories for thread-safe operations
- `AtomicInteger` for ID generation prevents race conditions
- Synchronized file access in DataPersistence

### Data Validation
- Email format validation (regex)
- Phone number validation
- Date range validation (start < end)
- Capacity validation (capacity > 0)
- Role-based permission checks

### Password Security
- SHA-256 hashing algorithm
- Passwords never stored in plain text
- Failed login attempt tracking
- Account lockout mechanism after 5 failures

### Date Handling
- `LocalDate` for dates (events, timesheets)
- `LocalDateTime` for timestamps (check-in, audit logs)
- Consistent MM-DD-YYYY format throughout UI
- `DateTimeFormatter` for parsing and display

### Hours Recording
- Direct entry of hours worked in attendance dialog
- No automatic calculation - users specify exact hours
- Hours stored as entered (no rounding)
- Example: User enters 2.5 hours → stored as 2.5 hours

### Emoji Support
- Font detection for emoji rendering
- Fallback chain: Segoe UI Emoji → Apple Color Emoji → Noto Color Emoji → Default

### Persistence Strategy
- Single-file database for simplicity
- Java serialization for easy object storage
- Atomic saves (write to temp, then rename)
- Automatic backup on startup (future enhancement)
